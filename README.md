# Flexilyzer

### Master's thesis in Informatics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)

### Creators: Petter Lauvrak & Jacob Theisen

## About

Flexilyzer is an innovative platform developed to address the challenges of analyzing and evaluating student code projects across diverse programming environments. This project was created by the authors with a vision to streamline and ease the work for professors and Teaching Assistants (TAs) of analyzing student code projects. Flexilyzer offers a multipurpose solution by enabling the execution of fully customizable Python scripts for the purpose of analysis and testing. This makes the system useful for a wide range of student projects and programming languages.

The main workflow of the system begins when a professor or TA creates an analyzer script by specifying input parameters from a student's code project, such as a `URL` to their GitHub repository or a `.zip` file, alongside desired outputs like test results and code quality scores. Following this, the script is executed on a specific assignment through Flexilyzer's backend infrastructure. The analyzer outputs are finally displayed on Flexilyzer's frontend Dashboard in a clear and tailored manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you can set up the project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

```
docker
docker-compose
```

## Setup Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run Flexilyzer on your local machine:

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flexilyzer.git
cd flexilyzer
```

### Running the project

```
cd application
```

Production:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Development:

```
docker compose -f dev-docker-compose.yml up --build
```

### Other commands

To seed the db and set up the tables go to the backend container and run:

```
python run_seed.py
```

In our project weÂ´ve used `Swagger` to create most of the `TypeScript Types` as well most API request logic for us, using the `openapi.json` schema automatically generated from `FastAPI`.

To update these `TypeScript Types` schemas for the `frontend` whenever there has been a relevate change to the `backend`, go to `application/client` and run

```
npx swagger-typescript-api -p http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json -o ./extensions --modular
```
